# Project Name

A short description of your project and what it does.

## Features

- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Feature 3

## Installation

Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.7 or higher).

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git

This template covers the basics: project description, installation, usage, contributing guidelines, and licensing. You can expand it with sections like **Tests**, **Configuration**, or **API Reference** depending on your project.  

If you want, I can make an **even shorter, ultra-minimal README** suitable for a small Python script.
